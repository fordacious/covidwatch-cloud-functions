	// would be possible if the two expirations were the same duration:
	// 1. User uploads a report and gets an upload token.
	// 2. User knows that they have a particular amount of time before their
	//    token will expire, so they wait until the last minute to call their
	//    health authority.
	// 3. Token expires, and document is remvoed from the database.
	// 4. A different user uploads a report, and is allocated the same token.
	// 5. Original user calls health authority, and provides token.
	// 6. Health authority verifies the original user's diagnosis, and verifies
	//    their token.
	// 7. The new report - associated with a different user - is published.
	//
	// We expect that a user will not wait /that/ long after they know that
	// their token has expired to try verifying their report with the health
	// authority, and so adding a period of time after which the token can no
	// longer be verified but during which the token cannot be re-allocated for
	// a new report minimizes the likelihood of this mistake happening.
